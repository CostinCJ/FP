"""
We want to get some practice with:
    1. Python 3
    2. Writing a menu-driven console application
    3. Generating some numbers :)
    4. Representing program entities

Let's implement something - Manage a list of rational numbers
    Functionalities:
        1. Add a new rational number from console
        2. Adding some random numbers programmatically
        3. Sort the list of numbers
        4. Exit the program
