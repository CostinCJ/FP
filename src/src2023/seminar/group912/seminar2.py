What we want to learn today:
    - menu-driven application
    - Python lists and dictionaries (a little bit)
    - manage a list of program entities (circles)
    - how to represent program entities (without classes and objects)

Problem statement
    A program that manages a list of circles
    A circle has a center (x,y) and a radius (r), r > 0, all ints
        - Add a circle from the console
        - Generate random circles
        - Sort the list by circle radius
        - Exit the program :)
